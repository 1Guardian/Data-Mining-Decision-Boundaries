# Data-Mining-Decision-Boundaries

This project shows how to plot voronoi diagrams to show the decision boundaries created by arbitrary points within a set of data.

The end of the project also has an explanation of how the decision boundaries are determined, but this work is not entire my own and is partially my lab partner's work, who is credited in the header of the pdf.

The project is in a pdf version of the ipynb for easier viewing by anyone
